# Updo Examples

_From Dhall configuration, generate Stack and Cabal projects with Dhall text templating_

Please see the [readme](https://github.com/cabalism/updo#readme) or
[announcement](https://blockscope.com/posts/2023-11-15-updo.html) for more
details on Updo itself. Here you'll find examples of projects converted to use
Updo to configure, generate and sometimes upgrade projects.

## Conversions

These Haskell projects have been upgraded to a published version of Updo, e.g.
`updo-1.0.0`, or have been upgraded to development version of Updo, identified
with a commit hash.

## Considered but Rejected

* [ghc/ghc](https://github.com/ghc/ghc)[^1]
* [github/semantic](https://github.com/github/semantic)[^2]

[^1]: When GHC builds with Cabal.
[^2]: It looks like the [github/semantic]() project is parked (["in
      flux"](https://github.com/github/semantic/issues/698#issuecomment-1503955816))
      with development shifted to
      [github/stack-graphs](https://github.com/github/stack-graphs), a rust
      project.
